# AJAX Task App
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/siakaramalegos/task-ajax.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/siakaramalegos/task-ajax)

I created this app as a learning project for Tech Talent South's code immersion bootcamp.  It is a Rails app that allows a user to manage their tasks, and the views are generated using JavaScript.
